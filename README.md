This Dispensary Management System streamlines healthcare services by enabling real-time doctor booking and efficient patient management across multiple dispensaries. Users can register, book available doctors, and track the current patient number in real time. This feature helps patients estimate their waiting time and decide when to arrive at the dispensary, reducing unnecessary crowding.
Doctors can manage their appointments and issue digital prescriptions, which are automatically sent to the pharmacy. Patients can then collect their prescribed medicines without delay.
By integrating real-time tracking and seamless doctor-patient interactions, this system enhances efficiency, minimizes waiting times, and improves the overall healthcare experience.
